 * Calculates an assignment's effective weight contribution to the overall grade.

 * 1. For non-grouped assignments: Uses direct weight value assigned to the assignment
 * 2. For grouped assignments: Derives weight from the group's total weight and the assignment's
 *    position within that group, using one of two methods:
 *    a. Equal distribution: Each non-dropped assignment gets an equal portion of the group's weight
 *    b. Manual weighting: Assignments with specified relative weights get proportionate shares
 *       of the group's weight based on those values
 *
 * @param assignment - The assignment to calculate effective weight for
 * @param allAssignments - All assignments in the course (needed for group calculations)
 * @param groups - All assignment groups in the course
 * @returns The calculated effective weight as a number, or null if not calculable
